# ARDUINO PROJECT: SOIL MOISTURE MONITORING SYSTEM

## NOMES DA EQUIPE:
- Nicole Webber Carloto
- Matheus Henrique Xavier

## OBJECTIVE
The main objective is to help check the humidity of the soil where the plant is located, indicating whether or not it needs watering. This way, the user can monitor and care for their houseplants more easily and efficiently.

## USEFULNESS
The usefulness of this feature is that it provides monitoring of soil moisture, allowing the user to quickly identify when the plant needs water. This facilitates the proper maintenance of houseplants, promoting more efficient care and avoiding both over- and under-watering.

## PROJECT COMPONENTS

### Electronics:
- **LEDs**: LEDs, or Light Emitting Diodes, are semiconductor devices that convert electrical energy directly into visible light. They consist of doped semiconductor materials, which emit photons when an electric current passes through them. The structure of an LED is composed of an anode (positive terminal) and a cathode (negative terminal), between which is located a semiconductor junction. *(MAKER HERO, 2024)*
- **220 and 10k ohm RESISTOR**: Resistors are passive electronic components whose main function is to limit or control the flow of electric current in a circuit. They are designed to have a specific electrical resistance, measured in ohms (Î©), and this resistance determines how difficult it is for electric current to flow through them. *(MAKER HERO, 2024)*
- **JUMPERS**: Jumpers are simply wires that have connector pins on each end, allowing them to be used to connect two points to each other without soldering. Jumper wires are typically used with breadboards and other prototyping tools to make it easier to change a circuit as needed. *(SPARKFUN EDUCATION, 2018)*
- **PROTOBOARDS**: A protoboard, also known as a breadboard, prototyping board or breadboard in English, is a temporary circuit board used for prototyping and testing electronic circuits. It has a series of holes where electronic components can be inserted and connected temporarily without the need for soldering. *(MAKER HERO, 2024)*
- **ESP32**: These are extremely powerful microcontroller boards, which are equipped with the modern ESP32 chip, which already comes with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, two very high-speed processors, DAC, ADC converters, PWM ports via software and a large program storage capacity. *(ELETROGATE)*
- **DHT11**: The DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor operates based on a capacitive sensor to measure the relative humidity of the air and a thermistor to measure the ambient temperature. It has a porous membrane that allows the humidity in the air to come into contact with the capacitive sensor, changing its capacitance according to the humidity. The thermistor records the temperature variation and both values are converted into digital signals by the sensor. *(MAKER HERO)*
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**: The resistive soil moisture sensor operates based on the variation of the electrical resistance of the soil according to its humidity. It consists of two metal probes that are inserted into the soil. When the soil is moist, its electrical resistance is lower due to the presence of water, allowing the electric current to flow more freely between the probes. *(MAKER HERO)*
